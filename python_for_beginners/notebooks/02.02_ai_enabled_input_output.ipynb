    "**In AI Systems:**\n",
    "- APIs are the foundation of all AI integrations\n",
    "- Understanding the API workflow is crucial for any AI application\n",

    "\n",
    "**In Agentic AI:**\n",

    "- Understanding of variables, strings, and f-strings (Lesson 01)\n",
    "- Ability to use `input()` function (Lesson 02)\n",
