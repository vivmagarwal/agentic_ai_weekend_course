## üìã Projects List

### Project 001: PDF RAG System
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vivmagarwal/agentic_ai_weekend_course/blob/main/mini_projects/project_001_pdf_RAG.ipynb)

**Description:**
Build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for PDF documents. This project demonstrates how to extract text from PDFs, create embeddings, store them in a vector database, and query the system using natural language.

**What You'll Learn:**
- PDF text extraction and processing
- Document chunking strategies
- Vector embeddings and similarity search
- Building RAG pipelines
- Integrating LLMs for question answering

**Technologies Used:**
- Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- PDF processing libraries
- Vector embeddings
- Python file handling

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed notebooks 1-8 from [Python for Beginners](../python_for_beginners/)
- Understanding of APIs and environment variables
- Basic knowledge of AI/LLM concepts

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
