# Restaurant Recommendation System - Requirements

## Introduction

### Problem Statement
Travelers and tourists visiting new cities face multiple challenges when looking for dining options:
- Discovering restaurants in unfamiliar locations is time-consuming
- Finding restaurants that match specific dietary preferences requires extensive research
- Existing recommendation lists may be outdated or not reflect current availability
- Language barriers and unfamiliar interfaces add friction to the search process

### Solution Overview
A simple, chat-based restaurant recommendation system that accepts natural language queries (e.g., "indian veg food in bangalore") and provides real-time, curated restaurant recommendations by searching the web using Tavily and Perplexity APIs.

### Target Users
- Travelers and tourists visiting new cities
- People in unfamiliar locations looking for dining options
- Users who prefer natural language interaction over structured forms

## User Stories

- **Story 1**: As a traveler arriving in a new city, I want to type my food preference and location in natural language so that I can quickly find relevant restaurants without navigating complex forms.

- **Story 2**: As a tourist with specific dietary preferences, I want to search for restaurants that match my cuisine type (e.g., "veg italian") so that I can discover suitable dining options in my current location.

- **Story 3**: As a user unfamiliar with the local area, I want to see restaurant ratings and descriptions so that I can make informed decisions about where to eat.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Natural Language Input Processing**
   - System must accept free-form text queries containing location and food preferences
   - Examples: "italian food near me", "indian veg food in bangalore", "chinese restaurants in downtown"
   - No structured form fields required

2. **Real-time Web Search**
   - System integrates with Tavily and Perplexity search APIs (configured in .env file)
   - Performs web search based on user's natural language query
   - Returns current, up-to-date restaurant information

3. **Restaurant Information Display**
   - **Must-have fields**:
     - Restaurant name and address
     - Cuisine type
     - Rating/reviews
     - Brief description
   - **Additional fields** (if easily available from search):
     - Operating hours
     - Price range
     - Phone number
     - Website/online presence
     - Any other relevant information from search results

4. **Search Results Curation**
   - Present results as a list of restaurants
   - Display all available information for each restaurant
   - Results should be relevant to the user's query

### User Interface

**Chat-Based Interface**
- Simple chat application interface
- Input: Text box for natural language queries
- Output: Chat-style display of restaurant recommendations
- Loading indicator while search is in progress
- Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- Clean, minimal UI following FastAPI fullstack MVP guide patterns

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Simple web interface (following MVP guide)
- **Search APIs**: Tavily + Perplexity (credentials from .env file)
- **Architecture**: Follow `/Users/vivmagarwal/Work/opensource/agentic_ai_course_uwc/.claude/guides/fastapi-fullstack-mvp-guide.md`

### Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Alpha Version Approach**: Show exact error messages for easier debugging

1. **No Restaurants Found**
   - Scenario: User searches for cuisine/location with no matches
   - Behavior: Display message: "No restaurants found for your query. Try different cuisine or location."

2. **Invalid/Unclear Input**
   - Scenario: User provides vague input (e.g., just "food")
   - Behavior: Ask for clarification via chat: "Please specify location and cuisine preference (e.g., 'italian food in Rome')"

3. **Search API Failure**
   - Scenario: Tavily or Perplexity API is down/unreachable
   - Behavior: Display exact error message from API for debugging
   - Example: "Search API Error: [exact error details]"

4. **Missing API Credentials**
   - Scenario: .env file missing Tavily or Perplexity keys
   - Behavior: Show configuration error with specific missing credential

5. **Network/Timeout Issues**
   - Scenario: Search takes too long or network fails
   - Behavior: Display timeout error with retry option

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Criteria
- System successfully processes natural language queries containing location and food preferences
- Returns relevant restaurant recommendations
- Displays all required information (name, address, cuisine, rating, description)
- Handles errors with clear, actionable messages

### Performance Expectations (Alpha)
- If the system returns relevant restaurants matching the query, it's working correctly
- No strict response time requirements for alpha version
- Focus on functionality over optimization
