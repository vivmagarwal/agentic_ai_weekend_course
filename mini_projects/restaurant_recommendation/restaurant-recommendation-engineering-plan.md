# Restaurant Recommendation System - Engineering Plan

## Usage
1. Read at session start
2. Update status after EACH task
3. Document discoveries inline
4. Keep sections current

## Workflow
1. Verify previous story = `completed`
2. Check ALL pre_implementation flags = `true` (never skip)
3. Execute task by task systematically
4. Update `task_notes` with context (critical - only source of truth)
5. Ensure working app after EVERY step

## Recommended MCP Servers
- **Playwright**: Verify UI changes in browser
- **Context7**: Get library docs (FastAPI, Tavily, Perplexity)
- **Firecrawl**: Test search functionality

## Rules
- NO legacy fallback (unless explicit)
- NO backwards compatibility (unless explicit)
- Simple, robust, reliable, maintainable code
- After EACH feature: run → test → verify
- Test external behavior (API calls, search results)
- Remove ALL mocks/simulations before completion
- Ask clarifying questions upfront
- Identify files to change per task

## Project Overview

A chat-based restaurant recommendation system that accepts natural language queries (e.g., "indian veg food in bangalore") and provides real-time restaurant recommendations using Tavily and Perplexity search APIs. Built with FastAPI backend serving a simple frontend from a single port, following the established MVP guide patterns.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language restaurant search
- Real-time web search via Tavily and Perplexity APIs
- Chat-style interface with loading states
- Comprehensive restaurant information display
- Alpha-stage transparent error messaging
- Mobile-responsive design

## Architecture Decisions

**Decision 1**: Dual Search API Strategy (Tavily + Perplexity)
- Reasoning: Tavily provides real-time web search with structured results; Perplexity provides AI-powered recommendations with natural language understanding. Using both and merging results gives better coverage.
- Impact: More comprehensive restaurant recommendations but requires parallel API calls and duplicate detection logic

**Decision 2**: Single-File Frontend Pattern (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Reasoning: Following FastAPI MVP guide pattern for zero-build deployment. Keeps project simple and independently sharable.
- Impact: No build tooling needed, uses Tailwind CDN, all UI code in frontend/index.html

**Decision 3**: Backend Serves Frontend from Root (/)
- Reasoning: Eliminates need for separate static file server or template directory. Single port deployment (8000) for entire application.
- Impact: One command runs everything: uvicorn app:app --reload

**Decision 4**: Alpha-Stage Transparent Error Messaging
- Reasoning: Requirements specify showing exact error messages for easier debugging during alpha phase
- Impact: All API errors, validation errors, and network issues display complete error details to user

**Decision 5**: In-Memory Chat (No Database)
- Reasoning: Alpha version doesn't require persistent chat history. Messages exist only during session.
- Impact: Simpler implementation, no SQLite needed, chat resets on page refresh

**Decision 6**: Intelligent Result Merging
- Reasoning: Both Tavily and Perplexity may return overlapping results. Merge by detecting similar names/addresses.
- Impact: Better user experience with deduplicated results, but requires string similarity logic

python app.py

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "italian veg", "location": "bangalore"}'

## Standards

### Code Style
- PEP 8 compliance for Python
- Type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Docstrings for public functions
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Pydantic models for data validation

### Naming Conventions
- Python: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- JavaScript: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
- Files: lowercase with underscores (snake_case)

### Error Handling
- Always return JSON error responses
- Include error message, error type, and status code
- Alpha version: Include full error details for debugging
- Validate all inputs with Pydantic
- Handle API failures gracefully

### API Endpoints

**Frontend**
- `GET /` - Serves frontend HTML (chat UI)

**API Routes**
- `POST /api/search` - Search restaurants by natural language query
  - Body: `{"query": "indian veg", "location": "bangalore"}`
  - Response: `{"restaurants": [...], "source": "merged", "processing_time": 1.23}`
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
  - Response: `{"status": "healthy"}`

### External APIs
- **Tavily Search API**: https://docs.tavily.com/sdk/python/reference
- **Perplexity API**: https://docs.perplexity.ai/

## Technical Notes

### Search Query Construction
- Tavily: `"{query} restaurants in {location}"` → advanced search depth, max 10 results
- Perplexity: System prompt guides JSON output format → model: sonar-pro

### Result Merging Logic
1. Fetch results from both APIs in parallel (asyncio.gather)
2. Parse both responses to Restaurant objects
3. Detect duplicates by comparing:
   - Exact name match (case-insensitive)
   - Address similarity (using simple string distance)
4. Keep unique restaurants, prefer Perplexity data if duplicate (more structured)

### Error Scenarios (Alpha Transparency)
- **No API keys**: "Missing TAVILY_API_KEY or PERPLEXITY_API_KEY in environment"
- **Tavily failure**: "Tavily API Error: [exact error details]"
- **Perplexity failure**: "Perplexity API Error: [exact error details]"
- **Network timeout**: "Search timeout. Please try again."
- **No results**: "No restaurants found for your query. Try different cuisine or location."
- **Unclear input**: "Please specify location and cuisine preference (e.g., 'italian food in Rome')"

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Tailwind utility classes for responsive design
- Container max-width: 2xl (672px) for readability
- Stack restaurant cards on mobile, grid on desktop
- Touch-friendly input and buttons (min 44px height)
- Auto-scroll to latest message on mobile

## Success Criteria Summary

The system is considered complete when all 9 acceptance criteria pass:

1. ✅ User can enter natural language query (e.g., "indian veg food in bangalore")
2. ✅ System processes and searches using Tavily/Perplexity APIs
3. ✅ Results show name, address, cuisine, rating, description
4. ✅ Additional info shown when available (hours, price, phone, website)
5. ✅ No results → clear message
6. ✅ Unclear input → clarification prompt
7. ✅ API errors → exact error messages
8. ✅ Responsive chat interface (mobile + desktop)
9. ✅ Follows FastAPI fullstack MVP guide structure

## Next Steps

1. Start with STORY-001: Project Setup
2. Verify all pre_implementation flags before starting each story
3. Execute tasks sequentially, updating status after each
4. Test thoroughly after each story
5. Update this plan with implementation notes as you go

Remember: This plan + codebase should contain ALL information a new developer needs to continue the project.
