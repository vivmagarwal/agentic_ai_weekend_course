        "- APIs are the foundation of all AI integrations - they let your code talk to powerful AI models\n",
        "- API keys provide secure, authenticated access to AI services\n",
        "- External packages (like google-generativeai) provide ready-made tools to interact with complex systems\n",
        "\n",
        "**In RAG Pipelines:**\n",
        "- RAG systems use APIs to send retrieved context + user query to LLMs\n",
        "- Your program retrieves relevant documents, then uses an LLM API to generate answers\n",
        "- This lesson teaches you the \"generation\" part of Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Agentic AI:**\n",
        "- Agents use LLM APIs as their \"brain\" to make decisions and generate responses\n",
        "- Every agent action involves an API call to process information and choose next steps\n",
        "- Learning API basics today prepares you to build autonomous AI agents tomorrow\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "- Understanding of variables, strings, and f-strings (Lesson 01)\n",
        "- Ability to use `input()` function and type conversion (Lesson 02)\n",
