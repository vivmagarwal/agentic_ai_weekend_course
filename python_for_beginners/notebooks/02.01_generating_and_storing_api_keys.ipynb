    "- Understand the difference between User Interfaces (UI) and Application Programming Interfaces (API)\n",
    "- Generate a free Gemini API key from Google AI Studio\n",
    "- Store API keys securely using multiple methods in Google Colab\n",
    "- Choose the right method for different scenarios\n",

    "## Why This Matters: Real-World AI/RAG/Agentic Applications\n",
    "**In AI Systems:**\n",
    "- APIs are the foundation of all AI integrations - they let your code talk to powerful AI models\n",
    "- API keys provide secure, authenticated access to AI services\n",
    "- Proper key management prevents unauthorized access and protects your usage limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**In RAG Pipelines:**\n",
    "- RAG systems use APIs to send retrieved context + user query to LLMs\n",
    "- Secure key storage ensures your RAG application runs safely in production\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Agentic AI:**\n",
    "- Agents use LLM APIs as their \"brain\" to make decisions and generate responses\n",
    "- Multiple agents may need to access the same API with proper authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Understanding of variables and strings (Lesson 01)\n",

    "**User Interface (UI)** - For humans:\n",
    "- Gmail UI: Click buttons, read emails, type messages\n",
    "- ChatGPT UI: Type in chat box, see responses\n",
    "- Google Docs UI: See formatted text, use menus\n",

    "**Application Programming Interface (API)** - For code:\n",
    "- Gmail API: Your code reads/sends emails automatically\n",
    "- OpenAI API: Your code sends questions ‚Üí receives AI responses\n",
    "- Gemini API: Your code talks to Google's AI programmatically\n",
