    "\n",
    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this practice session, you will have reinforced:\n",
    "- Using `input()` to get user data and `print()` to display output\n",
    "- Working with strings: concatenation, f-strings, and multi-line strings\n",
    "- Creating functions with parameters and return statements\n",
    "- Calling the Gemini API to generate images\n",
    "- Displaying AI-generated images in a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world AI applications, you constantly need to:\n",
    "- **Collect user input** and transform it into structured prompts\n",
    "- **Wrap logic in reusable functions** so you don't repeat yourself\n",
    "- **Connect to AI APIs** to generate text, images, or other content\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook combines all these skills into one practical project: building an **AI Image Prompt Generator** that takes a simple idea and creates a polished prompt for image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Prerequisites**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Variables and basic data types (Notebook 01)\n",
    "- Strings and user input (Notebook 02)\n",
    "- Functions with parameters and return statements (Notebook 03)\n",
    "- API keys and Gemini setup (Notebook 02.01, 02.02)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How This Notebook Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **revision practice** notebook - it's all hands-on exercises with no instructor demonstrations. Each activity builds on the previous one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Activity 1**: Build a prompt using string operations\n",
    "2. **Activity 2**: Wrap the logic in a reusable function\n",
    "3. **Activity 3**: Send the prompt to Gemini and display the generated image\n",
    "\n",
    "Each activity has **hints** (read these first if stuck!) and **solutions** (try on your own first!)."
